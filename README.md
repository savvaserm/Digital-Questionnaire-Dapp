Digital Questionnaire DApp made as part of my thesis. 

Technologies used: 

  1. Solidity 0.4.0
  2. PHP
  3. JavaScript
  4. CSS
  5. SQL
  6. Web3.js library

Used XAMPP as a local tomcat server and MySQL database in order to store the users and admins of the app. When the user enters the app and fills the questionnaire, the app generates a smart contract using solidity and deploys that contract to the ethereum network.
We can then extract all the info from the smart contract and provide a graph of the analytics from all users.

For deploying the smart contract we need a Metamask account to pay some fees for the deployment (with test ETH coins). Alternative we can use Ganache to create an account with test coins.
For interacting with Smart Contracts, Remix IDE was used.
